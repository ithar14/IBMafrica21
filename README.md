# IBM Quantum Challenge - Africa 2021
Sep 09 â€” Sep 21

The challenge consists of three labs covering three different applications of quantum computing. Each lab contains multiple exercises, taking you through the process of setting up your problem model, configuring your quantum algorithm, and solving for your problem by executing your quantum algorithm.

Each lab is presented as a Jupyter notebook which is hosted on the IBM Quantum Lab. Complete all exercises to complete the lab. You can track your progress, and view the current best score for the final lab, on this page.

To recognise your achievement in completing all labs, you will receive a digital achievement badge to showcase the skills you have developed during the challenge.

## Lab 1 : Introduction and the Crop-Yield Problem
In this lab, you will be introduced to quantum computing at a high level with Qiskit. This includes how to set up your problem definition as a quadratic program. To illustrate this, you will solve a simple agricultural optimization problem on the choice of crops for a farm, with the goal of increasing the yield. This lab focuses on access to food, an important problem for Africa, to guide you through your first steps in quantum computing.

## Lab 2 : Quantum Speedups in Finance
There is significant promise in applying quantum computing to the field of finance. One important financial computation is predicting the future price of derivative contracts, or options. The dynamics of the African financial markets are complicated and different to the rest of the world, increasing the complexity of models for predictions in this field. In this lab, you will learn how to construct a model for a QuantumTech share and calculate its expected value over a certain number of days, using both classical and quantum approaches.

## Lab 3 : Quantum Chemistry for HIV
HIV has affected many communities, especially in Africa. Though there has been significant research into treatments for the disease, there is still a lot of work to be done. Quantum computers have the promise of revolutionising the way we discover drugs and how we treat illnesses. This lab takes you through a demonstration of calculating whether a given drug would block the binding ability of the viral protein. Using advanced quantum algorithms and cutting-edge research, you will learn how to model and simulate the molecular interaction between the virus and a hypothetical drug.
